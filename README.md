Note that this is my first foray into open source projects... same licensing as the origin repo



Location Awareness for Google Voice and a Dialer

Google Voice Locations adds location awareness to Google Voice. Google Voice Locations allows phones to be enabled and disabled to ring based on location preferences.

It also features a callback dialer to supplement this missing feature in the official Google Voice app for Android.

Android Market

Visit the General Audience Website for a good overview of Google Voice Locations in action.

This software relies on the open source Google Voice Java API, a project we founded.
